            Okay, to be honest I do not know what I should say anymore, so I am just going to ramble on about things. Also like holy poop this H1 header is now super tiny, like I have to squint in order to see it. So, I overrode the size for the title, because I felt as if it would be more appropriate for the header to be really big. Anyways, since there are no requirements about what this text should say, I think I can pretty much talk about whatever I want on here.

            The previous paragraph looks like it was big enough, so I decided to move on to the second paragraph. Anyways, where was I? Ah right, this page is suppose to be about me isn't it? Okay, so hello to anyone who is reading this, although I highly doubt anyone would stay to read this whole thing because it is probably crazy boring. I am Eric Li and I am currently a sophmore at Northeastern <del>Highschool</del> University. To find out more about a boring mundane person such as myself, stay in tune for Chapter 3!

            Chapter 3???

            Okay, well congrats for being able to stay awake for this long. I probably would have given up after the first sentence. So anyways, the current classes I'm taking right now include Algorithms, Object Orientated Design, Computer Systems, and Web Development. I am actually swamped with so much homework right now that it's actually insane how I haven't drowned yet. I actually was overwhelmed with stuff since week 2, but here I am at week 4 still some how alive. Honestly, I don't know how much longer I can handle all these classes. I made a big mistake taking all these CS courses together. But alas, it is too late for that and I just need to endure it at least until I find my first Co-op. Speaking of Co-op, I'm actually searching for Co-ops this semseter too. I can only hope that a Co-op will accept me. Thanks for reading for this long.

            Here is a pic of me: <img src="derp.png" width="200" height="200"/>
            Okay so I just realized I need to change the border radius, but since the picture I originally got has a clear background I need to find a new image. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Okay here is my new image. <img src="corgi.jpg" width="400" height="400"/> This used to be a square, but now it has rounded corners.
